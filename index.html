        <h2>Catch the Point</h2>
        <p>
            You are the blue point trying to catch the red. 
            Every move, a random edge is removed. Try to corner the red point 
            before an edge is removed and the points are separated. Switch to defense mode 
            to try and evade red, and switch to two players to play with a friend.

        <h2>Triangle Push</h2>
        <p>
            The goal is to have a white triangle reach the top row of the board before a black triangle
            reaches the bottom row. Every move, a triangle can move one square up, down, left or right. 
            Land on an opposing triangle to capture the piece. Try to contain the enemy pieces while finding
            a path to victory.

        <h2>Find the Basis</h2>
        <p>
            Vectors <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> form a unit square, and span 2D space. 
            Drag and drop <em>i'</em> and <em>j'</em> to stretch, rotate, and flip the unit square so that the 
            blue point falls on red. Press go to see where your transformation maps
            the blue point. Click solve to see how to get a (non unique) solution.
            Click help to learn more about how the game works.

        <h2>Graph the Match</h2>
        <p>
            The red points are you and your friends, and the blue points are another group of friends. 
            Each person can talk to exactly one person at a time. The edge weights represent 
            the quality of conversation between any two people. Highlight the set of  
            edges that maximize the score for everyone involved. Press check
            to see if your matching is optimal.
